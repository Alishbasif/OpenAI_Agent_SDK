# 🔄 Agent Handoffs in OpenAI SDK
## 📘 What are Handoffs?

Handoffs allow one Agent to transfer control of a conversation or task to another Agent.
Think of it like a team:

## 🧑‍💻 Agent A: Handles customer queries

- 📊 Agent B: Handles billing issues

- 🛠️ Agent C: Handles technical support

Whenever one Agent detects that another is better suited, it hands off the conversation.

## ❓ Why use Handoffs?

- ✅ Divide complex tasks among specialized Agents

- ✅ Keep responses accurate & domain-specific

- ✅ Make multi-agent systems scalable

- ✅ Create real-world workflows (support bots, multi-domain assistants)

## 🚀 Handoffs in SDK

In the Agent SDK, handoffs are enabled using:

- handoff_description → Defines when and why to hand off

- Runner → Handles execution across multiple agents

## ⚡ How Handoffs Work?

- User sends input to Runner.

- Agent processes → checks handoff rules.

- If triggered → passes control to another Agent.

- New Agent continues conversation.

## ⭐ Next Steps

- Create specialized agents for different departments.

- Add guardrails before handoffs.

- Build multi-step workflows (General → Billing → Support)

## 🎯 Visual Flow

``` User --> GeneralAgent
``` GeneralAgent -- Billing query --> BillingAgent
``` GeneralAgent -- Tech query --> TechSupportAgent
``` GeneralAgent -- Normal query --> Response
